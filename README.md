# Quickbugs Report

This project intent to analisis the QuixBugs benchmark. The benchmark consists of 40 programs from the Quixey Challenge translated into Python programing language.


## Features or Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Our goal is to analyze the branch/mutation coverage of the initial test set provided by the benchmark and improve it in order to achieve an adequated test set for both criteria.

## Requirements

+ [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
+ [python3-venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
+ requirements.txt
