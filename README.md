# Quickbugs Report

This project intent to analisis the QuixBugs benchmark. The benchmark consists of 40 programs from the Quixey Challenge translated into Python programing language.


## Features or Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Our goal is to analyze the branch/mutation coverage of the initial test set provided by the benchmark and improve it in order to achieve an adequated test set for both criteria.

## Requirements

This section is optional if there isn't any special dependencies. Else a bulletlist will suffice, e.g.,
+ [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
+ [python3-venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
+ requirements.txt

## Installation or Getting Started

Getting started:

	git clone https://github.com/RenataBrito/quickfix_report.git
    cd quickfix_report
    python3 -m venv ~/quickfix_report/venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requiriments.txt

## Usage

Show how to use the project or library.
    
## Reference

+ [jxson](https://gist.github.com/jxson) - [README.md](https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669)
+ [gistfrojd](https://gist.github.com/gistfrojd) - [README.md](https://gist.github.com/gistfrojd/5fcd3b70949ac6376f66)

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
